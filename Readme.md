## Core Features

- **Ad Posting with Image Upload**: Users can effortlessly post ads with the option to upload images from their camera or gallery. The process is streamlined for ease of use.
- **Real-time Messaging via Firebase**: Communication is key in any marketplace. ADStore features real-time messaging enabled by Firebase, ensuring users can interact quickly.
- **Category-based Search for Efficiency**: I've implemented a category-based search feature, allowing users to quickly find exactly what they're looking for.
- **MapKit for Location Display**: Ads can be viewed on a map, thanks to the integration of MapKit, offering a geographical perspective to item hunting.
- **Custom Tab-bar for Navigation**: I've designed a custom tab-bar that enhances user navigation within the app, making the user experience smooth and intuitive.
- **Favorite Ads Feature**: Users can mark ads as favorites, allowing them to revisit items they are interested in easily.

## Technical Details

- **Firebase**: Utilized for real-time chat and user authentication.
- **JSON Server**: Used for managing the backend data, playing a crucial role in data handling and storage.
- **MapKit**: Integrated for mapping functionality, providing users with a visual representation of ADS locations.
